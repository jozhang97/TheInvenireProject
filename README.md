# TheInvenireProject

Tired of jamming to the same songs? Want to know what people around
you are listening to? Discover a new taste for music with Invenire, a
geolocation-based music discovery app. While listening to songs on
iTunes on your iOS device, open and login to Invenire and then share
the song you are listening to or see and like songs that other users
shared. Take a look at the map view to see songs people are listening
to around you.
